The HDV model is an optimization model that minimizes the total cost of capacity expansions and operations of storage (battery and hydrogen), small nuclear microreactors (SMR), solar PV, and purchase of electricity from the grid to meet charging stations' hourly demands across the United States in a given year, taken into account technology and power system constraints.
