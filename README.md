The HDV model is an optimization model that minimizes the total cost of capacity expansions and operations of battery storage, hydrogen storage, SMR, solar technology, and transmission lines, as well as purchase of power from the wholesale electricity markets to meet charging stations' hourly demands across the United States in a given year, taken into account technology and power system constraints.
